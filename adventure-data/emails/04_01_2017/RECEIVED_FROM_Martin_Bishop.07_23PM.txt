Richard,

Our partnership has worked for so long. When you first approached me with Sandford's secret designs, I couldn't believe my luck. Those designs have made us both very rich. But you got greedy. And now I have to finish our relationship. I should have known that a thief like you steals from everyone. If you don't return the documents by the end of the day, you will regret it.
