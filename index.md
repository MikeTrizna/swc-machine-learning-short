Machine learning has become the hot topic across so many different fields. It involves using different mathematical models to find patterns in data, often to make predictions for new data. It has seen great success for images, speech recognition, and a vast number of applications that we use everyday. But what does it actually involve? And how do you know if you're doing it well?

You're going to get stuck into some data and start making predictions using the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) machine learning library.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson assumes that you have some knowledge of the Python language. We will
> use the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) environment, so there is no need to install any software.
