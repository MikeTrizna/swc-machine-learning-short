The most challenging part of machine learning is getting good data, and enough of it. The more complex the machine learning method, the more data you need. Data can be continious (e.g. heights of patients), binary (e.g. wears glasses or not) or categorical (e.g. ). You may have a target variable, e.g. a field which you would like to predict for new data samples. This could be whether a patient has a disease, whether an image is a cat, etc. You may not have a target variable, and want to explore the data.

### Loading data

Load straight from scikit-learn or from a data-file?

### Exploring data

Some min,maxes might be a good idea

### Triaging data

Could we do some plots perhaps?

### Splitting data

Into training and test to begin with!
