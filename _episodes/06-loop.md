It's looping time

~~~
$ sh tools/decrypt.sh EINSTEIN emails/martin_bishop.SOMEDATA.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

## Loops

## Challenge

~~~
$ for email in emails/martin_bishop.*
$ do
$ sh tools/decrypt.sh EINSTEIN $email
$ done
~~~
{: .bash}

> ## Solution
>
> The command `ls -R` lists the contents of directories recursively, i.e., lists
> their sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on in alphabetical order
> at each level. The command `ls -t` lists things by time of last change, with
> most recently changed files or directories first.
> In what order does `ls -R -t` display things? Hint: `ls -l` uses a long listing
> format to view timestamps.

## Bonus Points

Can you decrypt any other emails using other passwords that you found?
